# Football Image Classification Project

## Description

This project is about predicting which team is on offense and which is on defense for a given football play. It contains models to draw bounding boxes for offense or defense on a play and models to predict whether a 
cropped image of just one team is on offense or defense. It also contains files on preprocessing and training these models, so you can train your own model if you have a different data set you would like to use. Object 
Detection (Bounding boxes) uses YOLOV8 and Image Classification uses Keras models.
